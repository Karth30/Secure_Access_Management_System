# Secure_Access_Management_System
An IoT Based Smart access system using ESP8266 and RFID.

RFID(Radio-Frequency Identification) is an automatic identification system that uses electromagnetic fields to transfer data between a RFID reader and an RFID tag. It is a contactless communication that enables storage and retrieval of information from a source.

 
An RFID System consists of a reader and one or multiple tags.
When a user presents his RFID badge to the reader, the system consults the dictionary and, based on the associated permission, can activate or not activate a relay. We have three modes, such that:

1)Authorized access is enabled in case of a positive match between the RFID code and the permission in the dictionary, the relay is activated.

2)Access denied if the RFID code is not present in the dictionary or if the associated permission is limited, the relay remains inactive.

3)In Flexible customization, the dictionary allows for flexible permission management, allowing the administrator to add, modify or revoke access to specific users as per the requirement.
